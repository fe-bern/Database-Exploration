## Project: Database Exploration
#### This is my final project at Spiced Academy. I wanted to compare different databases and use some tools, which are not part of the Spiced curriculum.
---
### Goal:
* Setting up a Data Collector
* Connecting to different databases:
  * `Postgres`
  * `MongoDB`
  * `MySQL`
  * `Redis`
  * `HBase`
  * `CouchDB`
* Using `Apache Spark` for analyzing the data
* Connecting everything via `Docker`


### Learnings
* Setting up MySQL 1st time really hard:
  * easy access via Docker CLI
  * Connecting db to MySQL Workbench -> create an (just another) Oracle account
  * allow specific IP's instead of localhost
  * giving users privileges

#### Why you maybe like MySQL
* MySQL Workbench super cool tool
  * easy to maintain, import/export data, visualization of data
  * schema is synonymous with a database

## Project: Database Exploration
This is my final project at Spiced Academy. I wanted to compare different databases and use some tools, which are not part of the Spiced curriculum.

### Goal:
* Setting up a Data Collector
* Connecting to different databases:
  * `Postgres`
  * `MongoDB`
  * `MySQL`
  * `Redis`
  * `HBase`
  * `CouchDB`
* Using `Apache Spark` for analyzing the data
* Connecting everything via `Docker`
